### What is monid, and why is it needed?

This skill gets its data through [monid](https://github.com/monid-ai/cli),
a CLI marketplace that routes to data providers (Twitter, LinkedIn,
Google Maps, etc.). It's **pay-as-you-go** — you fund a small balance and
each call costs a fraction of a cent to a few cents. There's no free tier;
without a funded monid key, this skill cannot fetch data.

On first run — or whenever the CLI/key is missing — surface this briefly to
the user, then proceed to setup. Each skill's SKILL.md gives an *estimated*
cost up front; actual cost is reported after each run.

### Install the monid skill

In addition to the CLI, install the upstream **monid skill** — it documents
the full discover → inspect → run workflow and keeps the agent's CLI
knowledge fresh:

```bash
npx skills add https://monid.ai/SKILL.md
```

(Or fetch <https://monid.ai/SKILL.md> directly and save it to your agent's
skills directory. The skill file's frontmatter `version` tracks updates;
re-install when it bumps.)

### Preflight (run at the start of every invocation)

```bash
monid --version || npm install -g @monid-ai/cli
```

If the CLI isn't installed, install it.

Make sure an API key is properly configured and activated (check with
`monid keys list`). If no active key shows up, walk the user through key
setup:

1. Create account → https://app.monid.ai
2. Add funds (pay-as-you-go balance) in the dashboard
3. Generate an API key → https://app.monid.ai/access/api-keys
4. Save it: `monid keys add -k <their-key> -l main`
5. Confirm: `monid keys list`

Verify balance with `monid balance` if you suspect it's empty.

### Agent rules

- Use the **CLI**, never an MCP `monid_run` tool — CLI is the reliable source
  of truth.
- Set `NO_COLOR=1` for clean scripted output.
- The CLI workflow is
  `monid run -p <provider> -e <endpoint> --query '<json>' -i '<json>' --wait <sec> -j -o <file>`.
- If an endpoint's params are ever unclear, run
  `monid inspect -p <provider> -e <endpoint>` first.
- **`-o <file>` strips the API envelope.** Both `monid run -o` and
  `monid runs get -o` write ONLY the `.output` value, not the full response.
  If the API docs show a response shape `{ output: { foo, bar } }`, the saved
  file's top-level keys are `foo` and `bar` — jq paths drop the `.output.`
  prefix. Without `-o` (i.e. stdout + `-j`), the full envelope is preserved.
